"Although TabPFN provides a powerful drop-in replacement for traditional tabular data models such as CatBoost, similar to these models, it is intended to be only one component in the toolkit of a data scientist. Achieving top performance on real-world problems often requires domain expertise and the ingenuity of data scientists. As for other modelling approaches, data scientists should continue to apply their skills and insights in feature engineering, data cleaning and problem framing to get the most out of TabPFN. We hope that the training speed of TabPFN will facilitate faster iterations in the data science workflow."
